### Post-Launch Engagement Tweets

**Feature Spotlight: Privacy**
```
🔒 Privacy isn't a feature.

It's a foundation.

Tactical Ops:
• No user accounts
• No cloud sync
• No data collection
• No tracking pixels
• No email verification

We built privacy into the architecture.
Not as an add-on, but as the core principle.

[Privacy diagram]
```

**Feature Spotlight: Design**
```
Why the tactical/military theme? 🎨

Because:
• Command centers look cool
• Dark mode is easier on eyes
• Orange accents pop
• Monospace fonts feel technical
• It's different from the "friendly" SaaS aesthetic

Plus, organizing tasks should feel like running a mission. 🎯

[UI showcase]
```

**Feature Spotlight: Technical**
```
How we achieve 100% privacy:

1. No backend servers
2. LocalStorage API for persistence
3. All processing happens client-side
4. Static hosting (no dynamic routes)
5. No external API calls

Your data literally never leaves your browser.

Open source, so you can verify: [GitHub Link]

❌ Invite team
⏰ 15 minutes later...

**Tips & Tricks**

💡 Tactical Ops Pro Tip:

Create custom columns for different contexts:
• URGENT (high priority)
• WAITING (blocked tasks)
• SOMEDAY (future ideas)
• REVIEW (needs assessment)

Your board, your rules. 🎯

[Custom columns example]
```

**Privacy Education**
```
🔒 Why local-first matters:

When your data is on someone else's server:
• They can read it
• They can sell it
• They can lose it
• They can change terms
• You lose control

With Tactical Ops, YOU own your data.

Always. 🎯

**Title:** [Release] Tactical Ops - Privacy-first Kanban board with zero backend

**Body:**
```
Hey r/selfhosted!

I built Tactical Ops - a Kanban board that runs entirely in your browser with zero backend infrastructure.

**Why this might interest you:**

• **True privacy**: All data stored in browser localStorage, nothing ever touches a server
• **No self-hosting needed**: Static files only, host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, your own nginx)
• **Works offline**: After first load, works without internet
• **No dependencies**: No database, no auth service, no nothing
• **Open source**: MIT licensed, fork and customize

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (static export)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (animations)
- LocalStorage API

**Features:**
- Full Kanban board with drag-and-drop
- Custom columns
- Task notes and descriptions
- Auto-save
- Responsive design
- Dark theme with tactical aesthetics

**Try it:** [LINK]
**Source:** [GitHub]

This is the antithesis of cloud services - your data never leaves your machine. Perfect for personal projects, sensitive work, or just preferring to keep things local.

Would love feedback from this community on improving it or features you'd like to see!

### r/privacy

**Title:** Built a Kanban board that respects your privacy (no account, no servers, no tracking)

**Body:**
```
Privacy advocates,

I created Tactical Ops after getting frustrated with project management tools that require accounts, track everything, and store your data on their servers.

**Privacy features:**
✅ No account creation
✅ No email required
✅ No cookies
✅ No analytics/tracking scripts
✅ No external API calls
✅ All data in browser localStorage only
✅ Works 100% offline

**How is this possible?**

The app is a static site (Next.js static export) that uses the browser's localStorage API. When you create tasks, they're stored directly in your browser's local storage. No data is ever transmitted to any server.

**Open source for transparency:**
GitHub: [LINK]

You can audit the code yourself - there literally isn't any backend code because there's no backend.

**Try it:** [LINK]

This is what privacy-by-design looks like. Not privacy as a premium feature, but as the foundation.

Feedback welcome!

### r/productivity

**Title:** I made a beautiful Kanban board that requires zero setup [Free, No account]

**Body:**
```
Hey r/productivity!

I built Tactical Ops - a Kanban board you can start using in literally 5 seconds.

**The pitch:**
- Click link → Start organizing
- No signup
- No configuration
- No installation
- Just works

**Why another Kanban tool?**

I was tired of:
- Creating accounts for simple tools
- Subscription fees for basic features
- Slow, bloated interfaces
- Losing data when services shut down

So I built something different:
✅ Privacy-first (data stays on your machine)
✅ Beautiful UI with smooth animations
✅ Fast (static site, no server requests)
✅ Free forever (open source)

**Perfect for:**
- Personal projects
- Side hustles
- Daily task tracking
- Quick brainstorming

**Try it:** [LINK]

Would love to hear what features you'd find useful!

### First Comment (Founder Story)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], maker of Tactical Ops.

ORIGIN STORY:

I built this out of frustration. I needed a simple Kanban board for personal projects, but every option required:
1. Creating an account
2. Verifying email
3. Choosing a plan
4. Learning a complex UI

I just wanted to organize some tasks. 🤷‍♂️

So I built Tactical Ops with three core principles:

1. **Privacy by Architecture**: We don't have a backend. Your data physically cannot leave your browser because there's nowhere to send it.

2. **Zero Friction**: Click → Work. That's it. No forms, no barriers, no BS.

3. **Beautiful UX**: Productivity tools don't have to be ugly. The tactical theme makes task management feel... epic?

TECH CHOICES:

• Next.js 14 (static export - no server)
• TypeScript (because bugs are annoying)
• Tailwind CSS (rapid UI development)
• Framer Motion (buttery smooth animations)
• LocalStorage API (your browser = your database)

WHAT'S NEXT:

This is v1.0. Roadmap includes:
• Dark/light theme toggle
• Import/export boards (JSON)
• Keyboard shortcuts
• PWA improvements
• Custom themes
• More column customization

100% of these will remain free. No premium tier. Ever.

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

And if you're privacy-conscious or tired of subscription fatigue, I hope this resonates. 🎯

Thanks for checking it out!

### Show HN Post

**Title:** Show HN: Tactical Ops – Privacy-first Kanban board with zero backend

**Body:**
```
Hey HN,

I built Tactical Ops (https://[your-domain]) - a Kanban board that runs entirely in your browser with zero backend.

Motivation: I needed a simple task board but didn't want to create yet another account or send my data to someone else's server.

Technical approach:
- Next.js 14 static export (no server-side rendering)
- LocalStorage for all persistence
- No external API calls (except loading the static assets)
- ~50KB gzipped for entire app
- Works offline after first load

The interesting bit is that privacy isn't a feature here - it's a consequence of the architecture. Since there's no backend, your data literally can't leave your browser. No database to breach, no API to intercept, no server logs to leak.

Trade-offs:
- No cross-device sync (by design)
- Data tied to browser localStorage (cleared if you clear site data)
- No real-time collaboration (it's single-user)

For me, these aren't bugs - they're features. I wanted a fast, private, personal task board. This is that.

Tech stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
License: MIT
Source: https://github.com/[username]/tactical-ops

Would love feedback from HN on:
1. The local-first approach - too limiting?
2. Architecture decisions - anything you'd do differently?
3. Features that would make this more useful while maintaining privacy?

Try it: https://[your-domain]
No signup, no tracking, no servers.

Thanks for looking!

## Community Engagement Scripts

### Response Templates

**When someone mentions privacy concerns:**
```
Great question! We built privacy into the architecture - your data is stored in your browser's localStorage and literally never transmitted anywhere. No servers = no data to breach. You can verify in the source code: [GitHub link]
```

**When someone asks about sync:**
```
Cross-device sync would require servers (defeating the privacy purpose). However, v2 will include export/import so you can manually sync across devices. For users who want cloud sync, you'll be able to self-host with your own sync solution.
```

**When someone compares to [competitor]:**
```
Both are great tools! Main differences:
• Tactical Ops = no account, local-first, privacy focus
• [Competitor] = cloud sync, collaboration, more features

It depends on your needs. We're focused on simple, private, personal task management.
```

**When someone reports a bug:**
```
Thank you for reporting! This is super helpful. Can you:
1. Share browser + version?
2. Open DevTools > Console, take screenshot?
3. GitHub issue: [link] (or I can create one if you prefer)

Really appreciate you taking the time to help improve this! 🙏
```

**When someone suggests a feature:**
```
Love this idea! We're tracking feature requests here: [GitHub Discussions link]

Would you mind adding it there with some context on your use case? Helps us prioritize based on what would be most valuable.

Thanks for the feedback! 🎯
